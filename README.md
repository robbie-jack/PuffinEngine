# Puffin Engine
Puffin Engine built with Vulkan

This is a 3D Game Engine built with Vulkan which serves as a foundation for different features and techniques I want to implement such as Lighting, Ray Tracing, Procedural Generation, Physics, etc...

Uses the following API's/Libraries:
Vulkan - https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/
GLFW - https://www.glfw.org/
ImGui - https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
ReactPhysics - https://www.reactphysics3d.com/
