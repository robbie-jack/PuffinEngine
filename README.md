# Puffin Engine
Puffin is a 3D Game Engine built with Vulkan which serves as a foundation for different features and techniques I want to experiment with, including Lighting, Ray Tracing, Procedural Generation, Physics, etc...

In Progress:

Finished basic material system and am now working on starting a basic game project using Puffin

Assets & Shaders used while developing Puffin are located here: https://github.com/robbie-jack/PuffinProject
