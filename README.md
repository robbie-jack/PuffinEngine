# Puffin Engine
Puffin is a 3D Game Engine built with Vulkan which serves as a foundation for different features and techniques I want to experiment with, including Lighting, Ray Tracing, Procedural Generation, Physics, etc...

In Progress:

Finished Re-Implementing a basic 3D Renderer in Vulkan using GPU Driven Rendering techniques. Now working on Implementing a basic material system and getting Puffin ready to be used for game projects.
